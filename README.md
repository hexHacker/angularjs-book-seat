Build setup: Babel, sourcemaps, dev server, testing courtesy of 
<a href='https://github.com/preboot/angular-webpack/blob/master/README.md'>angular-webpack</a> 


Instructions:

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`
